## Introduction üë®‚Äçüíª
It is a voice assistant which can be used to interact with your computer and also you have been seeing it in Iron man movies, but this JARVIS is not that much advanced as shown in movies. 

### Built with: Python<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" alt="Python" height="40" style="vertical-align:top">


## Cool functionalities of JARVIS üòé :)

I have wrote code which you can use JARVIS in the following ways :

- It can tell **count of Covid-19 cases for each state in India**
- It can do **Screen Recording with voice recording** stuff.
- It can also do **voice recording**
- It can access your **mobile camera**
- It can access your **web camera**

- <details>
  <summary>It can find the location of a phone number</summary>
  <br>
  
    Unfortunately there is no such thing as magic, and neither we, nor anyone else, have the ability to derive a phone‚Äôs location from an input string.
    
    <b>Here is what is actually happening:</b>

    The phone number is entered and a library is used to turn the country calling code into the name of the country. For example numbers starting with +91 becomes India, +880 is Bangladesh, +34 is Spain, etc.

    The country name is then sent to our geocoding API as a forward geocoding request (placename to coordinates). We then return the coordinates of the center of the country. For example we turn India into 22.3511148, 78.6677428, roughly in the middle of Uttar Pradesh.

    People get confused and angry as to why the coordinates are not actually where the phone is physically located.

    Reference: [We can NOT convert a phone number into a location. Sorry.](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/we-can-not-convert-a-phone-number-into-a-location-sorry)
